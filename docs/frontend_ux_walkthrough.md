# Frontend UX Walkthrough (ComfyUI-OpenClaw)

This document summarizes the current OpenClaw sidebar UI structure and how to verify it after changes.

## UI Structure

- Entry: `web/openclaw.js` registers the extension and sidebar tab.
- Shell: `web/openclaw_ui.js` renders the header, tab bar, and tab panes.
- Tabs: `web/openclaw_tabs.js` manages tab registration, rendering, and remount safety.
- API: `web/openclaw_api.js` provides a normalized fetch wrapper and OpenClaw endpoints (legacy Moltbot endpoints still work).
- Styles: `web/openclaw.css` provides shared design tokens and component classes.
- Errors: `web/openclaw_utils.js` provides `showError()` / `clearError()` helpers.

## Feature Gating (Capabilities)

- Backend exposes `GET /openclaw/capabilities` (legacy `/moltbot/capabilities` still works).
- Frontend fetches capabilities during setup and conditionally registers tabs:
  - `assist_planner` → Planner
  - `assist_refiner` → Refiner
  - `assist_streaming` → enable Planner/Refiner incremental live preview (fallback remains non-streaming)
  - `scheduler` → Variants (current gating)
  - `presets` → Library
  - `approvals` → Approvals

If capabilities are unavailable, the full tab set is registered to surface actionable errors (instead of “missing tabs”).
If `assist_streaming` is unavailable or the stream transport degrades, Planner/Refiner automatically fall back to the existing non-stream request path.

## Standalone Remote Admin Console

- Entry route: `GET /openclaw/admin` (legacy `GET /moltbot/admin` still works).
- HTML shell: `web/admin_console.html`
- Purpose: mobile-friendly standalone operations UI for non-sidebar workflows.
- Security model:
  - The page itself is a static shell and can render without authentication.
  - All write APIs still enforce backend admin policy (`X-OpenClaw-Admin-Token` and remote policy such as `OPENCLAW_ALLOW_REMOTE_ADMIN`).
- Runtime behaviors:
  - Dashboard summary + health/config snapshots
  - Jobs/Events polling + SSE stream connect/fallback
  - Approvals/Schedules/Triggers control actions
  - Config read/partial write and diagnostics access
  - Quick Actions (retry/refresh/drill) remain backend-authorized

## Remote Console Manual Checks

1. Open `http://<host>:<port>/openclaw/admin` from desktop and phone browsers.
2. Save an admin token via the console and verify protected actions succeed.
3. Clear token and verify write actions fail with explicit auth/policy errors.
4. Connect SSE, then trigger a run; verify event stream updates and fallback polling still works.
5. Confirm there is no blank/overflow breakage on narrow mobile widths.

## Quick Manual Checks

1. Open ComfyUI and confirm OpenClaw appears in the sidebar.
2. Switch between all visible tabs multiple times (and reopen the sidebar if possible) and ensure panes do not go blank.
3. Planner: click **Plan Generation** with minimal input and confirm either live preview/stage updates appear (when streaming is supported) or a readable fallback result/error appears.
4. Refiner: click **Refine Prompts** (with or without image) and confirm either live preview/stage updates appear (when streaming is supported) or a readable fallback result/error appears.
5. Library/Approvals: if backend endpoints are not enabled, confirm the UI shows a clear error state (no crashes).
6. If you simulate/fake a stream failure in dev tools, confirm Planner/Refiner retry through the classic non-stream path without duplicate submits or broken loading state.

## E2E (Playwright) Checks

- Run: `npm test`
- Tests live in: `tests/e2e/specs/`
- Harness: `tests/e2e/test-harness.html` (mocks ComfyUI core + basic OpenClaw API calls)
- Web helper/self-test harness: `web/tests/e2e-harness.html` (includes frontend helper and wrapper idempotence checks)
