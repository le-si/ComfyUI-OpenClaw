All E2E tests must be performed using the standard procedures defined in
`tests/E2E_TESTING_SOP.md`.

Scope note:
- `tests/E2E_TESTING_SOP.md` is frontend Playwright harness SOP.
- Backend real-E2E lanes (`tests.test_r122_real_backend_lane`, `tests.test_r123_real_backend_model_list_lane`) are governed by `tests/TEST_SOP.md`.
