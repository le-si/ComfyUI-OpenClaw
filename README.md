# ComfyUI-OpenClaw

![OpenClaw /run command example](assets/run.png)

ComfyUI-OpenClaw is a **security-first orchestration layer** for ComfyUI that combines hardened automation APIs, embedded operator UX, and production deployment controls:

- **LLM-assisted nodes** (planner/refiner/vision/batch variants)
- **A built-in extension UI** (`OpenClaw` panel)
- **A standalone Remote Admin Console** (`/openclaw/admin`) for mobile/remote browser operations
- **A secure-by-default HTTP API** for automation (webhooks, triggers, schedules, approvals, presets)
- **Public-ready control-plane split architecture** (embedded UX + externalized high-risk control surfaces)
- **Verification-first hardening lanes** (route drift, real-backend E2E, adversarial fuzz/mutation gates)
- **Now supports 7 major messaging platforms, including Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, LINE, WeChat, KakaoTalk, and Slack.**
- **And more exciting features being added continuously**

This project is designed to make **ComfyUI a reliable automation target** with an explicit admin boundary and hardened defaults.

## Security stance (how this project differs from convenience-first automation packs):

- Public MAE route-plane posture is a hard guarantee: startup gate + CI no-skip drift suites must both pass
- Control Plane Split is enforced for public posture: high-risk control surfaces are externalized while embedded UI stays on safe UX/read paths
- Profile-driven startup hardening with fail-closed enforcement in hardened mode
- Explicit **Admin Token** boundary for write actions
- Startup module capability gates (disabled modules do not register routes/workers)
- Localhost-first defaults; remote access is opt-in
- Localhost no-origin CSRF override posture is explicitly surfaced at startup and in Security Doctor, with audit visibility for operator review
- Strict outbound SSRF policy (callbacks + custom LLM base URLs)
- Webhooks are **deny-by-default** until auth is configured
- Encrypted webhook mode is **fail-closed** (invalid signature/decrypt/app-id checks are rejected)
- Bridge worker endpoints enforce device-token auth, scope checks, and idempotency handling
- Secrets are never stored in browser storage (optional server-side key store is local-only convenience)
- Cryptography dependency is required for secrets-at-rest encryption paths; WeChat AES ingress remains optional via `pycryptodomex`
- Tamper-evident, append-only audit trails for sensitive write/admin paths
- Hardened external tool sandbox posture with fail-closed checks and filesystem path guards
- Pack lifecycle file paths and pack API inputs are validated and root-bounded to prevent path traversal
- Replay risk is reduced with deterministic dedupe keys for event payloads without message IDs
- Endpoint inventory metadata and route drift tests to catch unclassified API exposure regressions
- Retry partition hardening now separates rate-limit and transport retry budgets with deterministic degrade decisions and lane-level diagnostics/audit evidence
- Adversarial verification is execution-gated (bounded fuzz + mutation smoke) in CI and local full-test/pre-push workflows with replayable artifacts
- Wave E closeout hardening: deployment profile gates and critical flow parity are now enforced together with signed policy posture control, bounded anomaly telemetry, adversarial fuzz validation, and mutation-baseline regression sensitivity checks
- Wave A/B/C closeout hardening: runtime/config/session stability contracts, strict outbound and supply-chain controls, and capability-aware operator guidance with bounded Parameter Lab/compare workflows
- Runtime guardrails are enforced as a runtime-only contract with diagnostics, clamping, and reject-on-persist behavior for safety-critical limits (timeouts/retries/queue bounds/provider safety defaults)
- Cryptographic lifecycle drills are automated with machine-readable evidence for rotation, revoke, key-loss recovery, and token-compromise fail-closed exercises
- Management query paths now use deterministic pagination normalization and bounded scans to reduce malformed-input abuse and unbounded admin/list query cost
- Compatibility matrix freshness/drift governance is operator-visible via Doctor checks and a repeatable refresh workflow with evidence output, reducing stale deployment assumptions before release

<details>
<summary><strong>Sprint A: closes out with five concrete reliability and security improvements</strong></summary>

- Configuration save/apply now returns explicit apply metadata, so callers can see what was actually applied, what requires restart, and which effective provider/model is active.
- The Settings update flow adds defensive guards against stale or partial state, reducing accidental overwrites.
- Provider/model precedence is now deterministic across save, test, and chat paths, and prevents model contamination when switching providers.
- In localhost convenience mode (no admin token configured), chat requests enforce same-origin CSRF protection: same-origin requests are allowed, cross-origin requests are denied.
- Model-list fetching now uses a bounded in-memory cache keyed by provider and base URL, with a 5-minute TTL and LRU eviction cap to improve responsiveness and stability.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Sprint B: ships security doctor diagnostics, registry quarantine gates, and constrained transforms defaults</strong></summary>

- Added optional remote pack registry quarantine controls with explicit lifecycle states, SHA256 integrity verification, bounded local persistence, and per-entry audit trail; this path remains disabled by default and fail-closed.
- Added optional constrained transform execution with trusted-directory + integrity pinning, timeout and output-size caps, and bounded chain execution semantics; transforms remain disabled by default and mapping-only behavior remains intact unless explicitly enabled.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Settings contract, frontend graceful degradation, and provider drift governance</strong></summary>

- Enforced a strict settings write contract with schema-coerced values and explicit unknown-key rejection, reducing save/apply regressions across ComfyUI variants.
- Hardened frontend behavior to degrade safely when optional routes or runtime capabilities are unavailable, with clearer recovery hints instead of brittle failures.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong> Security doctor, registry quarantine, and constrained transforms</strong></summary>

## Installation

- ComfyUI-Manager: install as a custom node (recommended for most users), then restart ComfyUI.
- Git (manual):
  - `git clone <repo> ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-openclaw`

Alternative install options:

1. Copy/clone this repository into your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` folder
2. Restart ComfyUI.

If the UI loads but endpoints return 404, ComfyUI likely did not load the Python part of the pack (see Troubleshooting).

## Quick Start (Minimal)

### 1 Configure an LLM key (for Planner/Refiner/vision helpers)

Set at least one of:

- `OPENCLAW_LLM_API_KEY` (generic)
- Provider-specific keys from the provider catalog (preferred; see `services/providers/catalog.py`)

Provider/model configuration can be set via env or `/openclaw/config` (admin boundary; localhost-only convenience if no Admin Token configured).

Notes:

- Recommended: set API keys via environment variables.
- Optional: for single-user localhost setups, you can store a provider API key from the Settings tab (UI Key Store (Advanced)).
  - This writes to the server-side secret store (`{STATE_DIR}/secrets.json`).
  - Environment variables always take priority over stored keys.

### 2 Configure webhook auth (required for `/webhook*`)

Webhooks are **deny-by-default** unless auth is configured:

- `OPENCLAW_WEBHOOK_AUTH_MODE=bearer` and `OPENCLAW_WEBHOOK_BEARER_TOKEN=...`
- or `OPENCLAW_WEBHOOK_AUTH_MODE=hmac` and `OPENCLAW_WEBHOOK_HMAC_SECRET=...`
- or `OPENCLAW_WEBHOOK_AUTH_MODE=bearer_or_hmac` to accept either
- optional replay protection: `OPENCLAW_WEBHOOK_REQUIRE_REPLAY_PROTECTION=1`

### 3 Optional (recommended): set an Admin Token

Admin/write actions (save config, `/llm/test`, key store) are protected by the **Admin Token**:

- If `OPENCLAW_ADMIN_TOKEN` (or legacy `MOLTBOT_ADMIN_TOKEN`) is set, clients must send it via `X-OpenClaw-Admin-Token`.
- If no admin token is configured, admin actions are allowed on **localhost only** (convenience mode). Do not use this mode on shared/public deployments.

Remote admin actions are denied by default. If you understand the risk and need remote administration, opt in explicitly:

- `OPENCLAW_ALLOW_REMOTE_ADMIN=1`

### Windows env var tips (PowerShell / CMD / portable .bat / Desktop)

- PowerShell (current session only):
  - `$env:OPENCLAW_LLM_API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"`
  - `$env:OPENCLAW_ADMIN_TOKEN="<YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN>"`
  - `$env:OPENCLAW_LOG_TRUNCATE_ON_START="1"` (optional: clear previous `openclaw.log` at startup)
- PowerShell (persistent; takes effect in new shells):
  - `setx OPENCLAW_LLM_API_KEY "<YOUR_API_KEY>"`
  - `setx OPENCLAW_ADMIN_TOKEN "<YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN>"`
  - `setx OPENCLAW_LOG_TRUNCATE_ON_START "1"` (optional)
- CMD (current session only): `set OPENCLAW_LLM_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>`
- Portable `.bat` launchers: add `set OPENCLAW_LLM_API_KEY=...` / `set OPENCLAW_ADMIN_TOKEN=...` (optionally `set OPENCLAW_LOG_TRUNCATE_ON_START=1`) before launching ComfyUI.
- ComfyUI Desktop: if env vars are not passed through reliably, prefer the Settings UI key store for localhost-only convenience, or set system-wide env vars.

## Remote Admin Console (Mobile UI)

The project now includes a standalone admin UI endpoint for mobile/remote operations:

- primary: `/openclaw/admin`
- legacy alias: `/moltbot/admin`

This page is independent from the embedded ComfyUI side panel and is intended for phone/desktop browsers.

### Environment variables for remote admin

Recommended baseline before enabling remote administration:

- `OPENCLAW_ADMIN_TOKEN=<strong-secret>`
  - required for authenticated write/admin operations from remote devices
- `OPENCLAW_ALLOW_REMOTE_ADMIN=1`
  - explicit opt-in for remote admin write paths
- `OPENCLAW_OBSERVABILITY_TOKEN=<strong-secret>` (recommended)
  - tokenized read access for observability routes in non-localhost scenarios

Optional but commonly used with planner/refiner workflows:

- `OPENCLAW_LLM_API_KEY=<provider-key>` (or provider-specific key vars)

### Connection from phone or other devices

1. Start ComfyUI with external listen enabled (example):
   - `python main.py --listen 0.0.0.0 --port 8200`
2. Use your host LAN IP (for example `192.168.x.x`) and open:
   - `http://<HOST_LAN_IP>:<PORT>/openclaw/admin`
3. Enter the admin token in the page input and click `Save`.
4. Click `Refresh All` to verify health and API reachability.

Notes:

- On Windows, if a port fails with bind errors (for example WinError 10013), choose a different port outside excluded ranges.
- If write actions are denied remotely, verify both `OPENCLAW_ADMIN_TOKEN` and `OPENCLAW_ALLOW_REMOTE_ADMIN=1`.

### Basic operations

After token save, typical flow is:

- `Dashboard`: confirm provider/model/key status and recent errors
- `Jobs / Events`: refresh runs, connect SSE stream, verify event updates
- `Approvals`: approve/reject pending items
- `Schedules / Triggers`: toggle schedules, run now, or fire manual trigger
- `Config`: reload and safely update provider/model/base URL/retry/timeout
- `Doctor / Diagnostics`: inspect security doctor + preflight inventory output
- `Quick Actions`: retry failed schedule, refresh model list, or run drill (subject to existing policy/tool availability)

### Reverse proxy and exposure notes

Do **not** expose ComfyUI/OpenClaw admin endpoints directly to the public internet without a hardened edge.

Minimum recommendations:

- terminate TLS at reverse proxy (HTTPS only)
- add authentication at edge (in addition to OpenClaw admin token)
- restrict source IP ranges when possible
- apply request-rate limits and connection limits
- keep server and node package on current patched versions

For internet-facing deployment templates and hardening checklist, follow:

- `docs/security_deployment_guide.md`

## Nodes

Nodes are exported as `Moltbot*` class names for compatibility, but appear as `openclaw:*` display names in ComfyUI:

- `openclaw: Prompt Planner`
- `openclaw: Prompt Refiner`
- `openclaw: Image to Prompt`
- `openclaw: Batch Variants`

See `web/docs/` for node usage notes.

## Extension UI

![OpenClaw /sidebar ui example](assets/sidebar.png)

The frontend lives in `web/` and is served by ComfyUI as an extension panel. It uses the backend routes below (preferring `/api/openclaw/*`).

### Sidebar Modules

![OpenClaw /sidebar ui example](assets/sidebar_modules.png)

The OpenClaw sidebar includes these built-in tabs. Some tabs are capability-gated and may be hidden when the related backend feature is disabled.

| Tab | What it does | Related docs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Settings` | Health/config/log visibility, provider/model setup, model connectivity checks, and optional localhost key storage. | [Quick Start](#quick-start-minimal), [LLM config](#llm-config-non-secret), [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) |
| `Jobs` | Tracks prompt IDs, polls trace/history, and shows output previews for recent jobs. | [Observability](#observability-read-only), [Remote Control (Connector)](#remote-control-connector) |
| `Planner` | Uses assist endpoint to generate structured prompt plans (positive/negative/params). | [Configure an LLM key](#1-configure-an-llm-key-for-plannerrefinervision-helpers), [Nodes](#nodes) |
| `Refiner` | Refines existing prompts with optional image context and issue/goal input. | [Configure an LLM key](#1-configure-an-llm-key-for-plannerrefinervision-helpers), [Nodes](#nodes) |
| `Variants` | Local helper for generating batch variant parameter JSON (seed/range-style sweeps). | [Nodes](#nodes), [Operator UX Features](#operator-ux-features) |
| `Library` | Manages reusable prompt/params presets and provides pack-oriented library operations in one place. | [Presets](#presets-admin), [Packs](#packs-admin) |
| `Approvals` | Lists approval gates and supports approve/reject operations. | [Triggers + approvals](#triggers--approvals-admin), [Remote Control (Connector)](#remote-control-connector) |
| `Explorer` | Inventory/preflight diagnostics and snapshot/checkpoint troubleshooting workflows. | [Operator UX Features](#operator-ux-features), [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) |
| `Packs` | Dedicated pack lifecycle tab for import/export/delete under admin boundary. | [Packs](#packs-admin) |
| `Parameter Lab` | Runs bounded sweep/compare experiments, stores history, and replays parameters back into the graph. | [Operator UX Features](#operator-ux-features) |

## Operator UX Features

### In-canvas context toolbox

Right-click a node and open the `OpenClaw` menu to access:

- `Inspect`: jump to the Explorer troubleshooting path.
- `Doctor`: run diagnostics and show readiness feedback.
- `Queue Status`: jump directly to queue/job monitoring.
- `Compare`: open Parameter Lab in compare setup mode for the selected node.
- `Settings`: jump to OpenClaw settings.

These actions are capability-aware and degrade to safe guidance when optional backend capabilities are unavailable.

### Parameter Lab history and replay

Parameter Lab now supports experiment history and run replay:

- `History` lists saved experiments from local state.
- `Load` opens stored experiment details and run statuses.
- `Replay` applies a selected run's parameter values back into the active workflow graph.

This makes iterative tuning and backtracking faster without manually retyping prior parameter sets.

### Compare workflow baseline

Parameter Lab includes a baseline compare flow for model/widget A/B style checks:

- Use `Compare` from the node context toolbox, or `Compare Models` inside Parameter Lab.
- The compare planner generates bounded runs from one selected comparison dimension.
- Backend compare submission is validated and admin-protected.
- Compare experiments are persisted and visible in history alongside sweep experiments.

Current scope is focused on bounded compare orchestration and replay-ready records; richer side-by-side evaluation and winner handoff are still being expanded.

### Operator guidance and quick recovery

Operator actions are wired for faster recovery loops:

- queue/status routing prefers the dedicated monitor view when available
- doctor checks surface immediate readiness feedback
- compare and history flows are connected so experiments can be reviewed and replayed quickly

## API Overview

### Base paths

Routes are registered to support both:

- New prefix: `/openclaw/*`
- Legacy prefix: `/moltbot/*`

And both:

- Direct: `/openclaw/...`
- ComfyUI API shim: `/api/openclaw/...`

Use `/api/...` from browsers and extension JS.

Machine-readable API spec:

- Generated OpenAPI spec: `docs/openapi.yaml` (derived from `docs/release/api_contract.md`; regenerate with `python scripts/generate_openapi_spec.py`)
- UI entry route: `GET /openclaw/admin` (legacy `GET /moltbot/admin`) serves the standalone remote admin console HTML shell; backend write actions still enforce admin-token and remote-admin policy.

### Observability (read-only)

- `GET /openclaw/health` -pack status, key presence, and basic metrics
- `GET /openclaw/logs/tail?n=50` - log tail (supports `trace_id` / `prompt_id` filters)
- `GET /openclaw/trace/{prompt_id}` -trace timeline (redacted)
- `GET /openclaw/capabilities` -feature/capability probe for frontend compatibility
  - includes feature flags such as `assist_planner`, `assist_refiner`, and optional `assist_streaming` (when incremental assist preview is available)
- `GET /openclaw/jobs` -currently a stub (returns an empty list)

Access control:

- loopback is allowed
- remote access requires `OPENCLAW_OBSERVABILITY_TOKEN` via `X-OpenClaw-Obs-Token`

### LLM config (non-secret)

- `GET /openclaw/config` -effective config + sources + provider catalog (observability-protected)
- `PUT /openclaw/config` -update non-secret config (admin boundary)
- `POST /openclaw/llm/test` -test connectivity (admin boundary)
- `POST /openclaw/llm/chat` -connector chat completion path (admin boundary)
- `GET /openclaw/llm/models` -fetch model list for selected provider/base URL
- `POST /openclaw/assist/planner` -planner structured prompt generation (admin boundary)
- `POST /openclaw/assist/refiner` -prompt refinement with optional image context (admin boundary)
- `POST /openclaw/assist/planner/stream` -optional SSE-style planner streaming path (`text/event-stream`, admin boundary)
- `POST /openclaw/assist/refiner/stream` -optional SSE-style refiner streaming path (`text/event-stream`, admin boundary)

Notes:

- Queue submission uses `OPENCLAW_COMFYUI_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:8188`).
- Planner/Refiner UI uses capability-gated assist streaming when available and falls back to the non-stream endpoints automatically.
- `PUT /openclaw/config` now returns apply metadata so callers can reason about what actually took effect:
  - `apply.ok`, `apply.requires_restart`, `apply.applied_keys`
  - `apply.effective_provider`, `apply.effective_model`
- Provider/model precedence is strict:
  - explicit request values > persisted config > provider defaults
  - model is revalidated against provider when provider changes (prevents cross-provider contamination)
- `POST /openclaw/llm/chat` in localhost convenience mode (no admin token configured):
  - allows same-origin loopback requests
  - denies cross-origin requests with CSRF error
  - if `OPENCLAW_LOCALHOST_ALLOW_NO_ORIGIN=true`, requests missing `Origin` / `Sec-Fetch-Site` are allowed for local tooling compatibility; this posture is explicitly surfaced in startup logs, Security Doctor, and audit events
- `/openclaw/llm/models` cache behavior:
  - key: `(provider, base_url)`
  - TTL: 5 minutes
  - capacity: 16 entries (LRU eviction)
- Custom `base_url` is protected by SSRF policy:
  - built-in provider hosts are allowlisted by default
  - allow additional exact hosts via `OPENCLAW_LLM_ALLOWED_HOSTS=host1,host2`
  - or opt in to any public host via `OPENCLAW_ALLOW_ANY_PUBLIC_LLM_HOST=1`
  - `OPENCLAW_ALLOW_INSECURE_BASE_URL=1` disables SSRF blocking (not recommended)
- Local providers (`ollama`, `lmstudio`) are loopback-only by design:
  - valid targets: `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` / `::1`
  - do **not** enable `OPENCLAW_ALLOW_INSECURE_BASE_URL` just to use local LLM
  - recommended examples:
    - Ollama: `http://127.0.0.1:11434`
    - LM Studio: `http://localhost:1234/v1`

### Webhooks

- `POST /openclaw/webhook` -authenticate + validate schema and return normalized payload (no queue submission)
- `POST /openclaw/webhook/validate` -dry-run render (no queue submission; includes render budgets + warnings)
- `POST /openclaw/webhook/submit` -full pipeline: auth -normalize -idempotency -render -submit to queue

**Payload mapping**:

- Submit arbitrary payloads (GitHub, Discord, etc.) by adding `X-Webhook-Mapping-Profile: github_push` (or `discord_message`).
- The internal engine maps fields to the canonical schema before validation.

**Job events**:

- `GET /openclaw/events/stream` -SSE endpoint for real-time job lifecycle events (queued, running, completed, failed).
- `GET /openclaw/events` -JSON polling fallback.
- Supports `Last-Event-ID` header to resume streams without data loss.

Request schema (minimal):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "template_id": "portrait_v1",
  "profile_id": "SDXL-v1",
  "inputs": { "requirements": "..." },
  "job_id": "optional",
  "trace_id": "optional",
  "callback": { "url": "https://example.com/callback" }
}
```

Auth headers:

- Bearer: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- HMAC: `X-OpenClaw-Signature: sha256=<hex>` (legacy header: `X-Moltbot-Signature`)
  - optional replay protection: `X-OpenClaw-Timestamp` and `X-OpenClaw-Nonce` (legacy `X-Moltbot-*`)

Callback allowlist:

- `OPENCLAW_CALLBACK_ALLOW_HOSTS=example.com,api.example.com`
- `OPENCLAW_CALLBACK_TIMEOUT_SEC=10`
- `OPENCLAW_CALLBACK_MAX_RETRIES=3`

### Triggers + approvals (admin)

- `POST /openclaw/triggers/fire` -fire a template with optional approval gate
- `GET /openclaw/approvals`
- `GET /openclaw/approvals/{approval_id}`
- `POST /openclaw/approvals/{approval_id}/approve` -can auto-execute
- `POST /openclaw/approvals/{approval_id}/reject`

Admin boundary:

- `OPENCLAW_ADMIN_TOKEN` via `X-OpenClaw-Admin-Token`
- strict localhost auth is enabled by default (`OPENCLAW_STRICT_LOCALHOST_AUTH=1`)

### Schedules (admin)

- `GET/POST /openclaw/schedules`
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /openclaw/schedules/{schedule_id}`
- `POST /openclaw/schedules/{schedule_id}/toggle`
- `POST /openclaw/schedules/{schedule_id}/run`
- `GET /openclaw/schedules/{schedule_id}/runs`
- `GET /openclaw/runs`

### Presets (admin)

- `GET /openclaw/presets` and `GET /openclaw/presets/{preset_id}`:
  - public-read is allowed only when `OPENCLAW_PRESETS_PUBLIC_READ=1` **and** `OPENCLAW_STRICT_LOCALHOST_AUTH=0`
  - otherwise requires admin token
- `POST/PUT/DELETE /openclaw/presets*` always require admin token

### Packs (admin)

- `GET /openclaw/packs`
- `POST /openclaw/packs/import` (multipart upload)
- `GET /openclaw/packs/export/{name}/{version}`
- `DELETE /openclaw/packs/{name}/{version}`

Packs are **versioned zip bundles** (templates/presets/profiles) with an integrity manifest (file hashes).
Import/export is designed to be **reproducible** and hardened against common archive attacks (path traversal, zip bombs).

Operational notes:

- Packs are **local-only by default** (no auto-download).
- Packs management requires the Admin Token boundary (or localhost-only convenience mode).
- UI: `OpenClaw` panel -> `Packs` tab.
- Verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_packs_integrity -v`

### Bridge (sidecar; optional)

Sidecar bridge routes are registered under `/openclaw/bridge/*` and `/moltbot/bridge/*`.
This repository provides both bridge API routes and a sidecar worker runtime path.

Bridge route groups:

- Core bridge routes:
  - `GET /bridge/health`
  - `POST /bridge/submit`
  - `POST /bridge/deliver`
  - `POST /bridge/handshake` (protocol compatibility check during sidecar startup)
- Worker bridge routes:
  - `GET /bridge/worker/poll`
  - `POST /bridge/worker/result/{job_id}`
  - `POST /bridge/worker/heartbeat`

Enablement and auth (device token model):

- `OPENCLAW_BRIDGE_ENABLED=1`
- `OPENCLAW_BRIDGE_DEVICE_TOKEN=...`
- optional allowlist: `OPENCLAW_BRIDGE_ALLOWED_DEVICE_IDS=dev1,dev2`

Callback delivery allowlist (sidecar HTTP adapter):

- `OPENCLAW_BRIDGE_CALLBACK_HOST_ALLOWLIST=example.com`

Standalone worker runtime:

- Entrypoint: `python scripts/start_sidecar.py`
- Required:
  - `OPENCLAW_BRIDGE_URL`
  - `OPENCLAW_WORKER_TOKEN`
- Optional:
  - `OPENCLAW_WORKER_ID`
- Current implementation note:
  - worker queue/result/heartbeat persistence is in-memory (MVP); use persistent backing for production durability.

## Advanced Security and Runtime Setup

### Runtime hardening and startup gates

- Runtime profile resolution, startup security enforcement, module startup boundaries, and bridge protocol compatibility are documented in:
  - `docs/runtime_hardening_and_startup.md`
- Key settings:
  - `OPENCLAW_RUNTIME_PROFILE` (`minimal` or `hardened`)
  - `OPENCLAW_BRIDGE_ENABLED`
  - `OPENCLAW_BRIDGE_DEVICE_TOKEN`, `OPENCLAW_BRIDGE_ALLOWED_DEVICE_IDS`

### Remote registry sync and constrained transforms

- Optional remote registry sync and constrained transform execution are documented in:
  - `docs/advanced_registry_and_transforms.md`
- Key settings:
  - `OPENCLAW_ENABLE_REGISTRY_SYNC`, `OPENCLAW_REGISTRY_POLICY`
  - `OPENCLAW_ENABLE_TRANSFORMS`, `OPENCLAW_TRANSFORM_*`

### Connector command authorization policy

- Connector command authorization and allow-from policies are documented in:
  - `docs/connector.md#command-authorization-policy`
- Key settings:
  - `OPENCLAW_COMMAND_OVERRIDES`
  - `OPENCLAW_COMMAND_ALLOW_FROM_PUBLIC`
  - `OPENCLAW_COMMAND_ALLOW_FROM_RUN`
  - `OPENCLAW_COMMAND_ALLOW_FROM_ADMIN`

## Templates

Templates live in `data/templates/`.

- Any `data/templates/<template_id>.json` file is runnable (template ID = filename stem).
- `data/templates/manifest.json` is optional metadata (e.g. defaults).
- Rendering performs **strict placeholder substitution**:
  - Only exact string values matching `{{key}}` are replaced
  - Partial substitutions (e.g. `"foo {{bar}}"`) are intentionally not supported

For the full step-by-step guide (where to put exported workflow JSON, how to author `manifest.json`, how to verify `/openclaw/templates`, and how to use `/run`), see `tests/TEST_SOP.md`.

### Basic `/run` usage (chat)

**Free-text prompt mode (no `key=value` needed):**

```
/run z "a cinematic portrait" seed=-1
```

The connector will map the free text into a prompt field using:

- `allowed_inputs` if a single key is declared in `manifest.json`, or
- fallback order: `positive_prompt` -> `prompt` -> `text` -> `positive` -> `caption`.

**Key=value mode (explicit mapping):**

```
/run z positive_prompt="a cat" seed=-1
```

Important:

- Ensure your workflow uses the same placeholder (e.g., `"text": "{{positive_prompt}}"`).
- `seed=-1` gives random seeds; a fixed seed reproduces outputs.

## Execution Budgets

Queue submissions are protected by concurrency caps and render size budgets (`services/execution_budgets.py`).

Environment variables:

- `OPENCLAW_MAX_INFLIGHT_SUBMITS_TOTAL` (default: 2)
- `OPENCLAW_MAX_INFLIGHT_SUBMITS_WEBHOOK` (default: 1)
- `OPENCLAW_MAX_INFLIGHT_SUBMITS_TRIGGER` (default: 1)
- `OPENCLAW_MAX_INFLIGHT_SUBMITS_SCHEDULER` (default: 1)
- `OPENCLAW_MAX_INFLIGHT_SUBMITS_BRIDGE` (default: 1)
- `OPENCLAW_MAX_RENDERED_WORKFLOW_BYTES` (default: 524288)

If budgets are exceeded, callers should expect `429` (concurrency) or `413` (oversized render).

## LLM Failover

Failover is integrated into `services/llm_client.py` and controlled via runtime config:

- `OPENCLAW_FALLBACK_MODELS` (CSV)
- `OPENCLAW_FALLBACK_PROVIDERS` (CSV)
- `OPENCLAW_MAX_FAILOVER_CANDIDATES` (int, 1-)

## State Directory & Logs

By default, state is stored in a platform user-data directory:

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\comfyui-openclaw\\`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/comfyui-openclaw/`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/comfyui-openclaw/`

Override:

- `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=/path/to/state`

Logs:

- `openclaw.log` (legacy `moltbot.log` is still supported)
- Optional startup truncation: set `OPENCLAW_LOG_TRUNCATE_ON_START=1` to clear the active log file once at process startup (useful to avoid stale-history noise in UI log views).
- Optional structured JSON logs for selected core paths:
  - set `OPENCLAW_LOG_FORMAT=json` (or `OPENCLAW_STRUCTURED_LOGS=1`) before startup
  - default behavior remains plain text logs (no structured log emission unless opt-in)

## Troubleshooting

### UI shows Backend Not Loaded / endpoints return 404

This means ComfyUI did not load the Python part of the pack or route registration failed.

Steps:

1. Check ComfyUI startup logs for import errors while loading the custom node pack (search for `openclaw`, `Route registration failed`, `ModuleNotFoundError`).
2. Confirm the pack folder is directly under `custom_nodes/` and contains `__init__.py`.
3. Run the smoke import check inside the same Python environment ComfyUI uses:

   ```bash
   python scripts/openclaw_smoke_import.py
   # or
   python scripts/openclaw_smoke_import.py --verbose
   ```

4. Manually verify the endpoints used by the Settings tab:

   - `GET /api/openclaw/health`
   - `GET /api/openclaw/config`
   - `GET /api/openclaw/logs/tail?n=50`

Notes:

- If your pack folder name is not `comfyui-openclaw`, the smoke script may need `OPENCLAW_PACK_IMPORT_NAME=your-folder-name`.
- If imports fail with a `services.*` module error, check for name collisions with other custom nodes and prefer package-relative imports.

### Operator Doctor

Run the built-in diagnostic tool to verify environment readiness (libraries, permissions, contract files):

```bash
python scripts/operator_doctor.py
# Or check JSON output:
python scripts/operator_doctor.py --json
```

### Webhooks return `403 auth_not_configured`

Set webhook auth env vars (see Quick Start) and restart ComfyUI.

### LLM model list shows `HTTP 403 ... Private/reserved IP blocked: 127.0.0.1`

This error usually means your OpenClaw version is older than the local-loopback SSRF fix.
For local providers, `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` are valid targets and do not require insecure SSRF flags.

Checklist:

1. Update OpenClaw to the latest release.
2. For Ollama:
   - run `ollama serve`
   - verify `http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/tags` is reachable on the same machine
3. In OpenClaw Settings:
   - Provider: `Ollama (Local)` or `LM Studio (Local)`
   - Base URL: leave empty (use provider default) or set loopback URL explicitly
4. Keep these flags disabled:
   - `OPENCLAW_ALLOW_ANY_PUBLIC_LLM_HOST=0`
   - `OPENCLAW_ALLOW_INSECURE_BASE_URL=0`

### Admin Token: server-side vs UI

`OPENCLAW_ADMIN_TOKEN` is a **server-side environment variable**.
The Settings UI can **use** an Admin Token for authenticated requests, but **cannot set or persist** the server token.

Full setup steps: see `tests/TEST_SOP.md`.

## Tests

Run unit tests from the repo root:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"
```

## Updating

- Git install: `git pull` inside `custom_nodes/comfyui-openclaw/`, then restart ComfyUI.
- ComfyUI-Manager install: update from Manager UI, then restart ComfyUI.

## Remote Control (Connector)

OpenClaw includes a standalone **Connector** process that allows you to control your local instance securely via **Telegram**, **Discord**, **LINE**, **WhatsApp**, **WeChat**, and **KakaoTalk**.

- **Status & Queue**: Check job progress remotely.
- **Run Jobs**: Submit templates via chat commands.
- **Approvals**: Approve/Reject paused workflows from your phone.
- **Secure**: Outbound-only for Telegram/Discord. LINE/WhatsApp/WeChat/KakaoTalk require inbound HTTPS (webhook).
- **WeChat encrypted mode**: Official Account encrypted webhook mode is supported when AES settings are configured.
- **KakaoTalk response safety**: QuickReply limits and safe fallback handling are enforced for reliable payload behavior.

- [See Setup Guide (`docs/connector.md`)](docs/connector.md)

## Security

Read `SECURITY.md` before exposing any endpoint beyond localhost. The project is designed to be secure-by-default (deny-by-default auth, SSRF protections, redaction, bounded outputs), but unsafe deployment can still create risk.

### Security Deployment Guide

- [Security Deployment Guide](docs/security_deployment_guide.md)
- Includes three copy-paste deployment profiles (`local`, `lan`, `public`) and step-by-step checklists.

### Deployment Self-check Command

Validate current env against deployment profile:

```bash
python scripts/check_deployment_profile.py --profile local
python scripts/check_deployment_profile.py --profile lan
python scripts/check_deployment_profile.py --profile public
```

Fail on warnings too (recommended for hardened/public pipelines):

```bash
python scripts/check_deployment_profile.py --profile public --strict-warnings
```

## Disclaimer (Security & Liability)

This project is provided **as-is** without warranty of any kind. You are solely responsible for:

- **API keys / Admin tokens**: creation, storage, rotation, and revocation
- **Runtime configuration**: environment variables, config files, UI settings
- **Network exposure**: tunnels, reverse proxies, public endpoints
- **Data handling**: logs, prompts, outputs, and any content generated or transmitted

### Key Handling Guidance (all environments)

- **Prefer environment variables** for API keys and admin tokens.
- **UI key storage (if enabled)** is for local, single-user setups only.
- **Never commit secrets** or embed them in versioned files.
- **Rotate tokens** regularly and after any suspected exposure.

### Common Deployment Contexts (you must secure each)

- **Local / single-user**: treat keys as secrets; avoid long-term browser storage.
- **LAN / shared machines**: require admin tokens, restrict IPs, disable unsafe endpoints.
- **Public / tunneled / reverse-proxy**: enforce strict allowlists, HTTPS, least-privilege access.
- **Desktop / portable / scripts**: ensure secrets are not logged or persisted by launchers.
